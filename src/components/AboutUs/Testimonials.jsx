            Just got to see the posts, we are glad we worked with AVIAR Builder . They are absolutely amazing. Helped us
            in every selection. They were very patient, listened to our needs throughout the construction. Mike did a
            wonderful job redesigning the 2nd floor to our custom requirements. Patrick is no less, he was charged in
            the last moment and took atmost care of everything until hand-over. It was very helpful to understand the
            estimates. Bob used to say- 'I'll not compromise on the quality' and he stood by his words. AVIAR Builder
            has a wonderful tool- Buildertrend, where in they uploaded progres of build, all owner documents for
            reference. During the closing, they showed us the home insulation results , which turned out to be the best
            insulated house. Not all construction companies do this. And the best part is, even post closing, team is
            very responsive. Thanks a lot Bob & team.!

            AVIAR Builder renovated my kitchen/dining room and also put on a new, improved deck. Both were very well
            done and met my expectations. Any issues that occured, and there are always some issues, were resolved
            quickly. I'd work with them again.
