          <p className="textalign">
            This is the first step in building the home of your dreams. We believe it is essential that you trust your
            builder. When you choose AVIAR Builders you will have an open line of communication. We strive to have a
            relationship with our customers where they can reach out to us and communicate throughout the building
            process, and we will do the same. We will also be listening to your wishes, desired amenities, location
            preferences, price point, etc.

          <p className="textalign">
            You will meet our team of professionals and discover what makes AVIAR Builders the right choice. We realize
            it’s the little things that make a difference, and it all begins with open communication. It is critical for
            us to keep you involved and informed throughout the building process. We will start with a meeting that
            gives you a clear understanding of the contracts, specifications and steps ahead. Then our preferred trades
            and vendors go to work with you in mind. We value your investment and build every home like it is our own.
            We want you to enjoy building your dream home and believe that the systems we have in place will allow you
            to do so!

          <p className="textalign">
            The building process is complete, but we are not done yet. Therefore, during your new home orientation, we
            will also walk the house and itemize any concerns you may have before closing and punch these items out
            before moving you in. Nothing is more fulfilling to our AVIAR Builders Team, than handing over the keys with
            zero items remaining on the list at closing. This is why we do what we do. We love handing you the keys to
            your new home!

          <h5 className="textalign">SERVICE</h5>
          <p className="textalign">
            After closing, we aren’t going anywhere, but we want you to enjoy your new home. Therefore, unless there is
            an emergency, we will see you at 11 months after the home has had time to breath and settle in, at which
            time our Customer Liaison will make a home visit to discuss and complete your 11 month punch list. This is
            where AVIAR Builders proves its commitment to our clients and honoring the privilege to be their Builder.
