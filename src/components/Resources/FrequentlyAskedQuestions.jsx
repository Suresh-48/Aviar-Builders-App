            <h5 className="mt-2">HOW LONG DOES THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS TAKE FROM THE TIME WE SIGN CONTRACTS?</h5>
            <p className=" mb-4">
              The construction process for AVIAR Homes averages around five months or 180 days. While we usually strive
              for this goal, there are outstanding conditions such as weather, job site conditions, and change orders
              that can extend the process. However, we will not sacrifice Quality for Time.

              WHAT TYPE OF MONETARY CONSIDERATION IS REQUIRED BEFORE THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS CAN BEGIN?
            </h5>
            <p className=" mb-4">
              In order to solidify your decision to build with AVIAR Homes, a deposit is required. The amount of the
              deposit is decided during the preliminary meeting with the builder. This amount can vary greatly given the
              scope of work, but normally is between four to ten percent.

            <h5 className="mt-2">DO WE NEED TO ARRANGE FOR A CONSTRUCTION LOAN?</h5>
            <p className=" mb-4">
              If we build on your land - than yes. Buyer is responsible for securing appropriate financing prior to
              commencement of work. If we build on our land, then we will secure the financing. Another option is to
              Quit Claim the deed in AVIAR's name, which would enable us to finance as a Turnkey build. This would also
              serve as your earnest money down.

              therefore, our Project Manager is present at the job site on a daily basis to make sure our quality
              standards are met. They also coordinate and schedule our trade contractors & vendors at appropriate times

              Please recognize that we work hand-in-hand with various vendors, trade contractors, and suppliers who are
              experts in their own areas and who we hold in high regard. We recommend only certain vendors, trade
              contractors, and suppliers since they have proven their value to us over time and share our commitments to
              quality.
